# Part 2
1. The value '3' will be printed because 'i' is still accessible at line 12. Line 12 is still within the function scope.
2. The value '150' will be printed because 'dicountedPrice' is still accessible at line 13. Line 13 is still within the function scope.
3. The value '150' will be printed because 'finalPrice' is still accessible at line 14. Line 14 is still within the function scope.
4. The array '[50,100,150]' will be returned because 'discounted' is still accessible at line 16 when returning. Line 16 is still within the function scope. This array is the new discounted prices of the original prices in 'prices'.

7. The value '150' will be printed because 'finalPrice' is still accessible at line 14. The scope of 'finalPrice' is the function block, and line 14 is within the function block.
8. The array '[50,100,150]' will be returned because 'discounted' is still accessible at line 16 when returning. The scope of 'dicounted' is the function block, and line 16 is within the function block.
9. The code will return an error because the code attempts to reassign 'discounted' at line 8, which is not allowed since 'discounted' was already assigned at line 3 as a const.
10. The code will return an error because the code attempts to reassign 'discounted' at line 8, which is not allowed since 'discounted' was already assigned at line 3 as a const.
11. The code will return an error because the code attempts to reassign 'discounted' at line 8, which is not allowed since 'discounted' was already assigned at line 3 as a const.
